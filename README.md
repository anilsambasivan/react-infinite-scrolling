# react-infinite-scrolling
A simple infinite scrolling with react, readux, thunk, axios and typescript

This application connects to the https://api.stackexchange.com/ to get questions and you could scroll down to load mare result in aninfinite manner.

Note: there is some limit on the number of api call you could make to https://api.stackexchange.com/, so be aware if the result is not pulled and fter many reloads, this could be the reason.

This is really a basic implementation, I kep it as simple as possible, more sophisticated feature implementation could be done by extending this simple version.
